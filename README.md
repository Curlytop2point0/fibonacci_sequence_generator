# Overview

My name is Maxim Person and as a software engineer I aim to deepen my understanding of functional programming by developing a Fibonacci sequence generator using Erlang. This project demonstrates the core concepts of the Erlang language, such as recursion, pattern matching, process creation, and messaging.

The purpose of this software is to calculate and display the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number, showcasing the functional programming principles in Erlang. This generator can handle sequences up to the 100th Fibonacci number.
